## [A minimalistic Postman Project working with Collections and Runners]() 
This small project shows how we can work with collections and at the final stage of teste we do a runner with the requests we created. We define an environment and inside we define variables , in this case baseurl, token and userid. We work with a test api from https://reqres.in/. Then we create a collections of requests, and for every request we create a script to test the post response. After testing the 4 request we can do a runner and export the results.
